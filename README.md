# TripTally
TripTally is a social platform designed to help users rate and share their travel experiences while discovering new places to explore


TO DO
- dark mode doesn't work on all the extra sub files away from index.html

- build components for all the types: category, experience, location, profile, review, and get data from there
    - use the stars component for starring stuff
    - could use experience-mini as a framework for some of the other elements
    - need to add images in to some of the subpages based on initial spec and maybe main index.html (come to a decision based on other similar app designs)

- additional criteria for ratings
    - initial list was value for money, accessibility, etc.

- maybe add location/map stuff? and plot all the experiences on a map of the world?
